In this assignment, you are supposed to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset
items using a neural network-based model from the Tensorflow Keras library.
Answer the following questions
1) Plot the training and validation error and accuracy metrics.
2) What hyperparameters did you use to tune your model and why? For
example, the number of hidden layers, number of neurons, activation
function, input features, etc.
Deliverables (it is mandatory to provide answers to the questions to get full
grade):
1) Github code link with the readme and well-commented code.
2) A document providing answers to the above two questions.
3) A document of how your collaboration worked in the group and who
contributed to which module.
